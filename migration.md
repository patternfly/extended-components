# Frontend components -> patternfly/react-component-groups migration
​
This migration guide covers all components that have been moved from the Insights repository to the new PatternFly “React component groups” extension. The API changes resulting from this migration will affect aspects of each component’s usage implementation. This guide outlines these changes and provides solutions for replicating your previous implementation.
​
The guide should be applicable when migrating from frontend-components **version 3.8.0 and later**. Please be aware that `frontend-components` version 4 included an upgrade to PatternFly 5, which brought changes to CSS class names and the DOM representation of components.Although this did not change the API of individual components or their visual appearance, their DOM representation may be slightly different.
